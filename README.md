## 📍 Overview

The Paiper project is a web-based graphical programming platform that allows users to create visual patches by connecting various modules together. It utilizes the cables.gl library for rendering graphics and provides functionalities for creating, renaming, and setting values for variables within the patches. The project's value proposition lies in providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for creating complex graphical programs, making it ideal for artists, designers, and developers looking to experiment with visual programming.

## ⚙️ Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The system follows a simple, single-page web application architecture with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The canvas element is used for rendering graphics, and cables.gl is used for the graphical programming platform. Overall, the architecture is straightforward and well-organized.    |
| **📖 Documentation**   | The codebase lacks proper documentation. Some code comments are present, but overall documentation is insufficient. Developers working on the project may find it challenging to navigate and understand the codebase without additional documentation or comments.   |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The main dependencies of the system are cables.min.js, libs.core.min.js, lottie_svg.js, and ops.js. These external libraries are essential for handling UI operations, rendering graphics, and interacting with the graphical programming platform.    |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The system's code is organized into separate files handling different functionalities. vargetset.js stands out as it defines two classes, VarSetOpWrapper and VarGetOpWrapper, enabling easy creation, renaming, and value setting for variables in the patch. Overall, the codebase exhibits decent modularity by separating major functionality into distinct files.    |
| **🔌 Integrations**    | The project integrates with cables.gl by utilizing its JavaScript library to interact with the graphical programming platform. Other than that, no significant third-party integrations are apparent from the codebase. Extending integrations with further systems or services might be possible by leveraging standard web technologies and APIs.   |
