## ⚙️ Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **⚙️ Architecture**     | The codebase follows a client-side web architecture where HTML, JavaScript, and CSS are used to create the website. The canvas element is utilized for animation. Limited information provided to fully analyze the structural design.   |
| **📖 Documentation**   | No information is provided about the documentation, so it is difficult to assess the quality and comprehensiveness.  |
| **🔗 Dependencies**    | The code relies on external libraries such as cables.min.js, libs.core.min.js, lottie_svg.js, and ops.js. Detailed information about these dependencies is missing.   |
| **🧩 Modularity**      | The code contains separate JavaScript files for different functionalities, like cable interaction, variable operations, and UI updates. Modularity seems to be considered, but the details are not provided.    |
| **✔️ Testing**          | There is no information available about the testing strategies and tools used in the codebase.  |
| **⚡️ Performance**      | No specific information is given to evaluate the system's performance. It would require analyzing the code and running performance tests to assess speed, efficiency, and resource usage.   |
| **🔐 Security**        | No details provided about security measures. A code review and security analysis would be required to assess the security aspects of the system.   |
| **🔀 Version Control** | The code is hosted on GitHub, indicating the use of Git for version control. Branching, merging, and collaboration workflows can be facilitated through Git and GitHub's features.  |
| **🔌 Integrations**    | The code integrates with Google Analytics by including its integration code in the HTML file, but any other integrations are not specified. |
| **📶 Scalability**     | Insufficient information is provided to analyze the system's scalability. Scaling considerations often include architecture, databases, and caching strategies, which require further investigation.  |
